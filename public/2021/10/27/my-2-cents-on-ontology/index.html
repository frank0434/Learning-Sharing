<p>I believe that we have to standardise and integrate our data now to understand
the ever-growing complexity of science projects. The application of ontologies
had been trialed many times in other science domains, such as environmental
modelling and ecology. The early we start to build our ontologies, the sooner
we will benefit from them.</p>
<div id="what-is-ontology" class="section level1">
<h1>What is ontology</h1>
<p>The term may make people think that this is just another jargon from the data
science people and make them sounds like cool kids. It is not the case. ONTOLOGY
is a term well defined many moons ago by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). In
short, the word ONTOLOGY in the information science domain shares a similar
meaning as the word VOCABULARY. But with more formalisation in it to strictly
define relationships between concepts. Therefore, less chance to form
ambiguities which are the main difficulties for computers to help us integrate
and merge data without much human input. For example, we know that an apple is
from an apple tree, and it is probably placed in a bin or tray when the apple is
picked. But computers have no common knowledge to understand information that we
gained from life experience. So how can we incorporate our common sense into the
system that makes computers understand the relationships between concepts and
assist us to scale up our work efficiency? Ontology is the solution.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:ER">1</a> shows a realisation of an exemplar ontology for harvesting
fruits. Fruits are produced by trees. We often store apple fruits either in bins
or on trays depending on subsequent data collections. Each box represents a
concept (or an entity or a class or a variable or whatever we like to call) with
detailed descriptions (Attributes/Keys/Units etc) and relationships with other
boxes (Produce, are in/on). By having this simple but exactly defined
representation diagram, we can understand the whole picture. Computers can use
the information as well.</p>

<div id="why-do-we-need-it" class="section level1">
<h1>Why do we need it</h1>
<p>The entity-relationship (ER) model reveals part of the why already. This is
because that we will need to clarify all the doubts and make the ontology as
exact as possible before we can generate an ER model to represent the ontology
statically. We will standardise our thinking, sampling protocols and all other
related matters when we define the ontologies. Let’s build on the example in
Figure <a href="#fig:ER">1</a>. Now we have two teams, A and B, that are in two different
locations and want to measure fruits weight. Team A choose to use a weighing
scale and labelled fruits weigh as FW with a unit kilogram. In contrast, Team B
has a luxury grader that can automatically count and weigh fruits. Team B used
“fruits weight” as the variable name with the grader default unit of a gram.
There is no problem with the choices the two teams made given the fact that they
have no idea that their data would be merged at some point to investigate
spatial variations of fruits weight in these two locations. We have to invest
extra time and resources to clarify the history of two data sets collected by
Team A and B. The extra time and resources would be avoidable if we bring two
teams together and agree on one set of protocols to conduct the data collection
process.</p>
<p>Someone may argue that the problem could be easily solved by a grand <strong>EXCEL</strong>
metadata sheet and <strong>VLOOKUP</strong> tables. In certain settings, Excel is probably a
perfect solution for the task. However, this Windows-centred solution will be a
nightmare when we want to capture perennial production systems with multi-year,
-locations and -data types (genotype, phenotype, soil, climate, pest and
disease, pollination, orchard management, consumer insights etc). Ontology seems
the only viable solution that will warrant our data to meet the FAIR principles.
Data collection is expensive. Why won’t we want to do a bit more than the status
quo to make our valuable assets last longer and surely reusable?</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-get-it" class="section level1">
<h1>How to get it</h1>
<p>An iterative and collaborative approach will probably be the most efficient
approach to build upon existing ontologies. Figure <a href="#fig:WoW">2</a>
demonstrates a flowchart of ontology development. First thing first, we need a
team that has faith in ontologies to solve our data problems. Then, the team
gets to choose a domain to work on. Naturally, the team will search and examine
what is already there on the web, and consolidate information in hand to engage
with key stakeholders. The stakeholders’ engagement step is the most critical
and difficult one. Therefore, extra care might be needed to bring all
stakeholders on board, especially the data collection team. The data collection
teams usually have in-depth knowledge about the collection processes but are
often not necessary expose to the whole life cycle of the data. A set of agreed
raw ontologies will be produced by the joint efforts of all stakeholders. The
second last step is data annotation, which means we can actually apply the raw
ontologies to standardise our data (either historical or new). The last step is
only limited by our imagination. We can develop a whole graphic knowledge
database from the raw ontologies or simply format the ontologies with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/">Web
Ontology Language (OWL)</a>. Then we can move
on to another domain.</p>
