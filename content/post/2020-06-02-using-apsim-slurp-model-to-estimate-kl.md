# What is slurp 
The official [introduction](https://www.apsim.info/documentation/model-documentation/crop-module-documentation/slurp/) suggests that the slurp model in apsim framework can do two things:  
1. Users can simulate water uptake when users define the canopy of a plant.  
2. Users can simulate canopy development when users define the water supply in the soil.  

# Why slurp

Water extraction 

# How slurp

Two values are needed:   
1. $R/R_0$   to calculate the leaf area index and the height
2. extincation coefcient.  to calculainstte leaf area
